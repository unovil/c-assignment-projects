## Challenge 2

As of writing this (August 26), this is the **second** challenge of a chapter about Advanced Data Types. This project aims to use functions for integer array structures with a flexible array member.

## Like a library of functions

The list of functions and the structure definition is defined in `intarr.c` and `intarr.h`.

# Aims

- writes program that uses a flexible array member
- creates structure `myArray` that has
    1. `length`
    2. flexible array member `array`
- read in from user size of array at runtime
- allocate memory based on this size read
- set length and fill array with some dummy data
- print array elements

--- CHARACTER CHALLENGES ---
This program is designed to complete 2 character challenges.
This program can do 2 things:
    1. count the number of words and chars in a file or stdin
    2. convert an input from file into upper or lowercase

--- FLAGS USED ---
--help
launches the program help

--count [file]
counts the words and chars from an input
if file is inputted, the file is read. if file is not inputted, stdin is read.
(Take note to remove all trailing newlines from the file read before starting
 the program, otherwise it could give false results.)

--convert_case (file) (upper|lower|flip)
converts characters from a required file
by default, upper characters are converted to lower and vice versa.
you can add an "upper/lower" clause to make it explicit
